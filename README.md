# storm-websockets

![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/themasterchef/storm-websockets.svg?branch=master)

Currently far too unstable and raw for any serious use. Only download if you want to work on the source! You have been warned.

Library to use Websockets streams as a spout in Storm.

Loosely based, for the time being, on the TwitterSampleSpout in the storm-starter project.

Uses the [Java-Websockets](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket) server by TooTallNate.
